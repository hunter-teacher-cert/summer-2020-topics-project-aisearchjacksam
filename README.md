Mini Unit Breakdown with Student Deliverables
[2 lessons with an optional extension activity for day 3]

Day 1 - Subgoal label and Code a DFS method within the provided skeleton code (where we provide the data tree), students will write in the subgoals and the challenge extension is to code the DFS search using our skeleton code provided using Room.java CaveMap.java, CaveMapDriver.java). As a 2nd Extension Activity, students will attempt to subgoal label and build out a BFS search, and then print the path.

*Provided Skeleton code is complete (please note - you will need to remove the DFS method code in CaveMap.java prior to giving to students)

Day 2 - In pairs - Students will subgoal label an A* search method (Where we provide the data tree and path cost information including the h-values, on the student handout).  Students will work in teams of 2 as support pairings [identified from previous days work]. these teams will write out their subgoals for A* Search and as the challenge Extension, attempt to write out in pseudo-code as much of the A* search as they can.

Day 3 (Optional Extension)  - Students choose a search algorithm to finish exploring and coding.  Students share out their approaches and builds.  Students Analyze Runtimes and look at AI applications.
